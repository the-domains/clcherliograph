Welcome to HERliograph!  Where everyday heroines are celebrated.  Here you will find stories of women who have followed their passions and forged their own paths.  These heroines may be unseen or under appreciated, but they shine, enriching the world with their talent and energy.  Please meet a magical caregiver of children, transformational photographer, circus warrior,  grounded gardner, social worker, mindful chef, spirited housekeeper, social activist, and more.  May each of their stories inspire you to shine your own light.  We believe in our inner knowing.  We believe in tuning in.  We believe that meaningful connections with others leads to growth and greatness.  We believe that the heroic can be found in the big and the small.  We believe that being afraid is the first step along the heroic path.  We believe in women everywhere shining their light, reflecting and sustaining our humanity.  We believe in herliograph.
